Compile guide
=============

Linux:
    * Required libraries:
        * libsfml-2.x package (go to: http://www.sfml-dev.org and download it, 
        because the linux packet manager repositories are not up to date)
        * libGLEW.so.1.7.0 ( go to http://glew.sourceforge.net/ to get the correct version
        same problem like above)
        * libxmu-dev and libxmu6 (available over packet manager)
        * libxi-dev and libxi6 (also available over packet manager)
        * libglu1-mesa and libglu1-mesa-dev ( last but not least also available 
        over packet manager)
    * After installing these libraries run make.
    * To start the application run dist/Debug/GNU-Linux-x86/pong
